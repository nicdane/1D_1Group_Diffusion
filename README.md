# 1D_1Group_Diffusion
This is a very primitive (and buggy) project that aims to simulate monoenergetic steady-state neutron diffusion conditions in 1D.

Everything is contained in a single python file. All submethods (gauss-seidel solver, eigenvalue solver, matrix initializer) are relatively short in code length.

You will want to adjust some early parameters depending on the type of problem you're looking to solve.
